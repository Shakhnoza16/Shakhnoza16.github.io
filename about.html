      <p class="lineone">Many individuals take photographs to preserve the memories of key moments in their lives. I've always been interested in art and used to take pictures of anything with my phone since I was a kid.</p>
      <p class="linetwo">After a time, my parents got me a camera, and my hobby evolved into taking professional photographs. However, with the introduction of smartphones, it has become extremely simple to shoot photographs, because everyone now has such a device with them at all times. </p>
      <p class="linethree">As a result, I invite you to look at my portfolio, which includes photos taken not only with a professional camera, but also with a smartphone.</p>
